On my first trip I flew back from Osaka and the night before I met a delightful couple from Hiroshima who urged me to visit…. So this time I did and was amazed to find a really lovely city and do welcoming….such lovely people….and later also in Nagasaki. Kyushu is beautiful with many fishing villages and harbours and I certainly intend to return.\nThe best parts:\n\nEverything….. Japan fascinates me at every turn\n\nThe worst parts:\n\nPacking to journey home!"
