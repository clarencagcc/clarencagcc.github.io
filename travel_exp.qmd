## Philippines

It was an overall enjoyable trip. The weather was awesome, the private
water tours memorable and the Filipino food delicious.

**The best parts:**

-   The excelent level of communications with Philippines EVANEOS vendor
    Junji.
-   Working with Junji to have the best 22 day itinerary.
-   Excelent transportation and coordination within Country.
-   Good itinerary pace, with free time to explore areas on our own.
    Great selection of private tours.
-   Most of the hotels were great.
-   It was a great trip!

**The worst parts:**

-   Not worst part, but it was annoying: WNOTE: Most of the hotels were
    great! Hovever, there were two hotels that did not meet
    expectations. To be fare, I am not sure if it was due to room
    availability or available hotel choices (\*\*\*\*\*\* (2nights
    -uneven floors and\*\*\*\*\*\*(4 nights - shower overlapping with
    toilet area).

## Japan
The first time I visited Japan was in the Spring this year and I loved it so much I booked straight away again through Evaneos and insisted on Yuri as my travel planner as before.
On my first trip I flew back from Osaka and the night before I met a delightful couple from Hiroshima who urged me to visit.... So this time I did and was amazed to find a really lovely city and do welcoming....such lovely people....and later also in Nagasaki. Kyushu is beautiful with many fishing villages and harbours and I certainly intend to return.

**The best parts:**

- Everything..... Japan fascinates me at every turn

**The worst parts:**

- Packing to journey home!
